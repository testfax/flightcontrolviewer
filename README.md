# Usage
Reads Star Citizen Keybinds (actionmaps.xml) and transposes them into your joystick inputs and displays them over an image of the stick so you can easily tell what bind is associated with it.

# Device Compatibility
- Virpil Constellation Alpha Prime
- Virpil Ace-Torq

# More Devices...
- Other devices will be available once I get some assistance from other device owners.

# Current Version 1
- Has an error reporting feature that will directly send me any errors and logs.
- Using this software implicitly agrees with those until I push to version 2, where that will be disabled.

# Automatic Updates
- Automatic updates are enabled.
- Currently untested in 1.0.0, however base code works flawlessly in other projects so I assume it works here.
